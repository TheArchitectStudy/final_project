      <p><strong>Why is it important for women to pursue STEM careers?</strong> <br> <br> It's extremely important for women to pursue careers in the STEM fields because whether we like it or not, computers and technology are the future. All sorts of devices will become a part of every job in today's society, therefore it is important to be inclusive, and to have a diverse set of people. Women bring new ideas and skill sets to the table, which is exactly what we need in order to further advance the technology that is present all around us.  </br> </br> </p>
